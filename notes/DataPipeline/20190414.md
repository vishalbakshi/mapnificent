# Notes - Data Pipeline - 20190414

I think the following questions would help narrow our scope and outline future expansion tasks:

1. What would be considered an exhaustive dataset for the embed?
  - [ ] SFMTA Scheduled Data for all routes
  - [ ] SFMTA Realtime Data for all routes (I haven't actually seen/found this data but have heard it exists)
  - [ ] Scheduled BART data for SF stations
  - [ ] Realtime BART data for SF stations (they have a working API but I haven't used it yet)
  - [ ] Future/Proposed SFMTA Scheduled Data (how to come up with this data can blow the lid off this project (in a good way) for Data Scientists/Analysts)
2. What would the user be able to filter on the frontend? (Some UI sketches/stories for this would help focus the rest of the development)
  - [ ] Multiple routes
  - [ ] Modes of transportation (BART, Bus, Light Rail, Walking)
  - [ ] Current/Future routes
3. What would be considered the bare minimum dataset for the core functionality of the embed?
  - [ ] SFMTA Scheduled Data
  - [ ] Subset of SFMTA Scheduled Data (i.e. only Rapid lines)
  - [ ] SFMTA Realtime Data
  - [ ] Subset of SFMTA Realtime Data 
  - [ ] Scheduled BART data for stations only in SF
  - [ ] Subset of scheduled BART data for stations only in SF
  - [ ] Realtime BART data for stations only in SF
  - [ ] Subset of Realtime BART data for SF stations (i.e. only stations along Market st.)
