# May 13 Event: Outline

Essential Question: What should we present on May 13th?

## Proof of Concepts

## Idea 1: Slides only
  - In advance of the event, take screenshots of different rendered maps
  - Which routes, stations, walk times would we want to show?
  
## Idea 2: Slides + Local version
  - Modify the existing Mapnificent site:
    - Replace different cities with different routes
    - Before the event, pre-load gtfs .bin file for each route
    
## Idea 3: Slides + Local version with Filters 
  - Modify the existing Mapnificent site:
    - Allow user to toggle through the datasets in Idea 2
    - Add some UI elements that allow user to select a route, walk time, walk speed etc., "submit" and see the new rendering
    
## Idea 4: ???
## Idea 5: ???
