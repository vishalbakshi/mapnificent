# Notes - Map Features: 20190417 

All the mapping utilities are built with javascript, so we don't really need the static jekyll framework. Jekyll just erves to provide scaffolding in which to embed the [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) map. If this map is to be embedded on the SF Transit Riders site, it would be helpful to know the framework they use.

## Layers

Leaflet maps deal in layers, added one at a time, and in the case of Mapnificent there are two layers in play: 
1. the default tile layer (actual map tiles) 
  - these tiles are served by OpenStreetMap
  -  [map.addLayer(defaultTileLayer);](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/mapnificent/blob/master/_layouts/city.html#L124)
2. the calculated layer with transit distance
  - [added via mapnificent.init()](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/mapnificent/blob/master/static/js/mapnificent.js#L320)

To compare before/after transit improvements, we can probably create a new layer that replicates the loadData/prepareData logic but runs on a different data set. The data source is defined on [line 392](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/mapnificent/blob/master/static/js/mapnificent.js#L392) of mapnificent.js

## Control: toggling layers

Leaflet has some built-in methods for handling controls/toggling. [Example]((https://leafletjs.com/examples/layers-control/)

This can be experimented with by editing `_layouts/city.html` to include some additional markers and grouping them into a layer.
```
  var littleton = L.marker([39.61, -105.02]).bindPopup('This is Littleton, CO.'),
      denver    = L.marker([39.74, -104.99]).bindPopup('This is Denver, CO.'),
      aurora    = L.marker([39.73, -104.8]).bindPopup('This is Aurora, CO.'),
      golden    = L.marker([39.77, -105.23]).bindPopup('This is Golden, CO.');

  var cities = L.layerGroup([littleton, denver, aurora, golden]);

  var overlayMaps = {
      "Cities": cities
  };


  var mapnificent = new Mapnificent(map, city, {
    baseurl: '{{ site.baseurl }}/'
  });

  mapnificent.init();

  L.control.layers(overlayMaps).addTo(map);
```

So we could approach this by creating layers for each data set we use (i.e., with and without a certain transit line), and then toggle them on and off in the map.
